EmailCollectorTargetDir=It may be a desired behaviour to move the email into another tag/directory when it was processed successfully. Just set a value here to use this feature. Note that you must also use a read/write login account.
EmailCollectorLoadThirdPartyHelp=You can use this action to use the email content to find and load an existing thirdparty in your database. The found (or created) thirdparty will be used for following actions that need it. In the parameter field you can use for example 'EXTRACT:BODY:Name:\\s([^\\s]*)' if you want to extract the name of the thirdparty from a string 'Name: name to find' found into the body.
